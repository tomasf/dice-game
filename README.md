# Trash Can Dice Game

A two-player game with really simple rules:

Each player starts with 20 dice. Players take turns rolling one die and placing it in the corresponding slot on the trash can lid. If the slot is already occupied, the die is discarded into the trash can. The player who completes a set of numbers on the lid keeps those dice. The game ends when one player runs out of dice, making them the loser.

The lid is threaded, allowing you to screw it onto the trash can to serve as a container for the dice.
